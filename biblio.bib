	abstract = "Source current estimation from electromagnetic (MEG and EEG) signals is an ill-posed problem that often produces blurry or inaccurately positioned estimates. The two modalities have distinct factors limiting the resolution, e.g., MEG cannot detect radially oriented sources, while EEG is sensitive to accuracy of the head model. This makes combined EEG+MEG estimation techniques desirable, but different acquisition noise statistics, complexity of the head models, and lack of pertinent metrics all complicate the assessment of the resulting improvements. We investigated analytically the effect of including EEG recordings in MEG studies versus the addition of new MEG channels when computing noise-normalized minimum l(2)-norm estimates. Three-compartment boundary-element forward models were constructed using structural MRI scans for four subjects. Singular value analysis of the resulting forward models predicted better performance of the EEG+MEG case in the form of higher matrix rank. MNE inverse operators for EEG, MEG and EEG+MEG were constructed using the sensor noise covariance estimated from data. Metrics derived from the resolution matrices predicted higher spatial resolution in EEG+MEG as compared to MEG due to decreased spread (lower spatial dispersion, higher resolution index) with no reduction in dipole localization error. The effect was apparent in all source locations, with increased magnitude for deep areas such as the cingulate cortex. We were also able to corroborate the results for the somatosensory cortex using median nerve responses.",

	abstract = "This paper describes an application of hierarchical or empirical Bayes to the distributed source reconstruction problem in electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG). The key contribution is the automatic selection of multiple cortical sources with compact spatial support that are specified in terms of empirical priors. This obviates the need to use priors with a specific form (e.g., smoothness or minimum norm) or with spatial structure (e.g., priors based on depth constraints or functional magnetic resonance imaging results). Furthermore, the inversion scheme allows for a sparse solution for distributed sources, of the sort enforced by equivalent current dipole (ECD) models. This means the approach automatically selects either a sparse or a distributed model, depending on the data. The scheme is compared with conventional applications of Bayesian solutions to quantify the improvement in performance.",

    abstract = {To increase the reliability for the non-invasive determination of the irritative zone in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis, we introduce here a new experimental and methodological source analysis pipeline that combines the complementary information in EEG and MEG, and apply it to data from a patient, suffering from refractory focal epilepsy. Skull conductivity parameters in a six compartment finite element head model with brain anisotropy, constructed from individual MRI data, are estimated in a calibration procedure using somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and field (SEF) data. These data are measured in a single run before acquisition of further runs of spontaneous epileptic activity. Our results show that even for single interictal spikes, volume conduction effects dominate over noise and need to be taken into account for accurate source analysis. While cerebrospinal fluid and brain anisotropy influence both modalities, only EEG is sensitive to skull conductivity and conductivity calibration significantly reduces the difference in especially depth localization of both modalities, emphasizing its importance for combining EEG and MEG source analysis. On the other hand, localization differences which are due to the distinct sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG persist. In case of a moderate error in skull conductivity, combined source analysis results can still profit from the different sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG to accurately determine location, orientation and strength of the underlying sources. On the other side, significant errors in skull modeling are reflected in EEG reconstruction errors and could reduce the goodness of fit to combined datasets. For combined EEG and MEG source analysis, we therefore recommend calibrating skull conductivity using additionally acquired SEP/SEF data.},

	abstract = "Scalp electric potentials (electroencephalograms) and extracranial magnetic fields (magnetoencephalograms) are due to the primary (impressed) current density distribution that arises from neuronal postsynaptic processes. A solution to the inverse problem--the computation of images of electric neuronal activity based on extracranial measurements--would provide important information on the time-course and localization of brain function. In general, there is no unique solution to this problem. In particular, an instantaneous, distributed, discrete, linear solution capable of exact localization of point sources is of great interest, since the principles of linearity and superposition would guarantee its trustworthiness as a functional imaging method, given that brain activity occurs in the form of a finite number of distributed hot spots. Despite all previous efforts, linear solutions, at best, produced images with systematic nonzero localization errors. A solution reported here yields images of standardized current density with zero localization error. The purpose of this paper is to present the technical details of the method, allowing researchers to test, check, reproduce and validate the new method.",

    abstract = {{The well-known EM algorithm is an optimization transfer algorithm that depends on the notion of incomplete or missing data. By invoking convexity arguments, one can construct a variety of other optimization transfer algorithms that do not involve missing data. These algorithms all rely on a majorizing or minorizing function that serves as a surrogate for the objective function. Optimizing the surrogate function drives the objective function in the correct direction. This article illustrates this general principle by a number of specific examples drawn from the statistical literature. Because optimization transfer algorithms often exhibit the slow convergence of EM algorithms, two methods of accelerating optimization transfer are discussed and evaluated in the context of specific problems.}},
